## 💻 Plans for Own Analysis
- Analyze the results of CLIP performed with a protein other than LIN28 using the same method. When applying Guided Mission 3, I may need to adjust the methods depending on the experimental approach or protein type.

### Progress
- As an initial step, I applied the entropy and base mutation quantification pipeline from Guided Mission 3 to a CLIP-seq dataset of IGF2BP1 (GSE134383) focusing on the ACTB gene. This served as a prototype to test my ability to reuse core methods on a different RBP.
